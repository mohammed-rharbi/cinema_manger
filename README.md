# 🎬 Cinema Management Application

## 📜 Project Context

The mission of this project is to develop a management application for a cinema. The application will allow the management of movies, reservations, rooms, screenings, and available seats. In addition, the application should enable administrators to create other administrators, while customers can create their own accounts. Reservations can only be made if the customer is authenticated.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Manage movies, screenings, rooms, and reservations.
- Authenticate users (customers and administrators) to secure access to certain features.
- Administrators can manage the entire system, including creating new administrators.
- Customers need to sign up and log in to access reservation features.

## 🚀 Key Features

  Customers can create an account through the application (name, email, password, etc.) with data validation during registration.
  
- **Login and Authentication:**  
  Customers and administrators must log in to access certain features, such as reserving a seat for a movie.  
  **JWT** is used for secure session management.

- **Administrator Management:**  
  Administrators can create other administrators and have the ability to modify or delete administrator accounts.

### Movie Management

- Error handling to provide clear and detailed responses for CRUD operations.

### Database:
- **MongoDB** for storing user data, movies, screenings, reservations, and rooms.
- **Mongoose** for modeling data and managing relationships between movies, screenings, and rooms.
